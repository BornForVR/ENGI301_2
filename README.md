# Project 2: PCB Design for Simplified Assembly

## Overview
This project is an extension of Project 1, where we developed a system using a PocketBeagle to control various peripherals. The goal of Project 2 is to streamline the assembly process by creating a dedicated PCB, which reduces the complexity of wiring and provides a hands-on experience in PCB design.

## Features
- **Female Pin Connectors**: For easy connection to the display and rotary encoder.
- **Male Connectors**: To connect two stepper motor drive boards.
- **Simplified Wiring**: Reduces the clutter and potential errors associated with manual wiring.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:


### Installing
A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

- **Clone the repo to your local machine.
- **Ensure you have a suitable PCB fabricator ready to produce the board.
- **Gather all necessary components as listed in the documentation.

- ## Usage

Solder the headers to the PCB as indicated in the design files.
Attach the display and rotary encoder to the female connectors.
Connect the stepper motors to the male connectors.
Connect the PocketBeagle according to the schematic provided.


## Built With
- **Eagle PCB Design Software** - Used to create the PCB layout.
